# Sleep-Health-and-Lifestyle-Analysis
Uncovering the Relationships Between Sleep Quality, Lifestyle Factors, and Overall Health

## Introduction
Sleep is a fundamental element of human life, it has known that sleep-deprived issues and illness have an singificant impact on our daily lives, productivity, and long-term wellbeing. Understanding the factors that influence sleep quality and duration is crucial for developing better health interventions and promoting healthier lifestyle choices.

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset from Kaggle, collected with 400 individual records. The dataset provides an overall picture of sleep health by including demographic information (gender, age, occupation), sleep metrics (duration and quality), lifestyle behaviors (physical activity level, daily steps), physiological indicators (BMI category, blood pressure, heart rate), psychological factors (stress levels), and clinical outcomes (presence or absence of sleep disorders.

This dataset gives a unique opportunity to understand how various aspects of modern lifestyle intersect with sleep health across different demographics and occupations, enabling us to uncover patterns that may inform personalized health recommendations.

## Research Objectives
The goals of this analytic project are to show:

1. Overall distribution of gender, occupation,BMI categories
2.Explore demographic and occupational patterns in sleep duration and quality across the 400-person sample
3. Quantify relationships between physical activity metrics (activity level, daily steps) and sleep outcomes
4. Investigate physiological correlations linking BMI, blood pressure, heart rate, and sleep quality
5. Assess the impact of stress levels on sleep duration, quality, and disorder prevalence
6. Identify risk factors associated with sleep disorders 

## Why this Analysis Matters



## Dataset Overview
The Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset comprises 400 rows and Key Features of the matrics, covering a wide range of variables related to sleep and daily habits.

- Physical Activity (minutes/day): The number of minutes the person engages in physical activity daily.
- Stress Level (scale: 1-10): A subjective rating of the stress level experienced by the person, ranging from 1 to 10.
- BMI Category: The BMI category of the person (e.g., Underweight, Normal, Overweight).
- Blood Pressure (systolic/diastolic): The blood pressure measurement of the person, indicated as systolic pressure over diastolic pressure.
- Heart Rate (bpm): The resting heart rate of the person in beats per minute.
- Daily Steps: The number of steps the person takes per day.
- Sleep Disorder: The presence or absence of a sleep disorder in the person (None, Insomnia, Sleep Apnea).

- Insomnia: The individual experiences difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, leading to inadequate or poor-quality sleep.
- Sleep Apnea: The individual suffers from pauses in breathing during sleep, resulting in disrupted sleep patterns and potential health risks.
